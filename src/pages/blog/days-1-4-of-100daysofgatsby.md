# What is 100 Days of Gatsby?

Similar to fun daily challenges like [DailyUI](https://www.dailyui.co/), the team at Gatsby started this guided coding challenge to start off the year. This challenge is great for newbies or experts in React, SSG (static site generators), Node, JavaScript, and (obviously) Gatsby. The Gatsby team will be sending out coding challenges throughout the 100 days in order to help people interested in these areas grow their skillset! If you want to read more about this challenge or sign up to take part, you can do so [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/).

## Preface

An important thing to note is that I've been playing around with Gatsby for a couple weeks, so much of these first few days will be quite a bit of review for me. Despite that being the case, I am definitely not advanced enough to jump into their advanced recommendations like building a theme, plugin, or a more complex app. It also seems like the challenges will not be day-to-day, so much of these days will be self-imposed challenges.

# Challenge #1

## Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

> "Why share all of your ideas with just Reddit and Twitter? Your best writing needs a home - on your very own blog!
>
> This week, let's get a Gatsby blog up-and-running from scratch. You'll get practice setting up your local environment, creating new pages from React components, sourcing content from Markdown files, and deploying your site to a host!" - Gatsby

This seemed like a straightforward challenge to me, as I had done this work a couple of times already. Once when I set up a blog site following Andrew Mead's [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&t=15125s), and another time when I rebuilt much of my personal website from scratch.

The resources for this challenge were the [beginner tutorials, lessons 1-8](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/?utm_campaign=100%20Days%20of%20Gatsby&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=81388107&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_sJX-Be9TzKzO1lHCCt5S8INRGd-X_jwpVK8tg_G5Fc8YU4x7MWqLBybIXnwl_AZiB32PPQ5XI8YV52oTPn15XPGA6PJIvFP-KBMxux5t4NzAQi1Q&_hsmi=81388107). Honestly, I was able to get something up and running the first night, so I was in a good spot. I had done my previous explorations using CSS modules to style components and then styled-components, so I decided to do some light styling using emotion, which is a CSS-in-JS solution similar to styled-components.

## Closing

After this point, I had completed the first challenge, but was still not ready to build something like a Gatsby blog theme. Originally, I thought the challenges were going to be different every day (like DailyUI), but I quickly realized that wasn't the case & I was pretty far ahead already. So my self-imposed challenges were going to have to be my way to keep myself coding every day. For the next batch of days, I set my sights on hooking the blog up to NetlifyCMS and adding dark mode.
