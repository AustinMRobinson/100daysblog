## About Page

I added some much better content to the About page! Now I have a photo of me and a little bio of information about me. I took this opportunity to set up the page as its own CMS item on the NetlifyCMS. This means that all of the page content (title, heading, subheading, bio, bio image, location, etc.) is all pulled from the CMS-populated markdown file. This will be the de facto setup for all pages moving forward.

## Editorial Workflow

Although this wasn't one of my goals for this batch of days, it was a welcome addition. One of my pet peeves of using  NetlifyCMS for writing my blog posts was that it did not allow me to save drafts. I wanted to use it to keep track of the work I did while I did it. Luckily I discovered that adding `publish_mode: editorial_workflow` to my `config.yml` file allowed me to access more features in NetlifyCMS! 

Enabling this meant that I could now categorize posts into 'Drafts', 'In Progress, and 'Ready'. This helped allowed me to write my posts beforehand to keep track of the work I did during the batch of days.
