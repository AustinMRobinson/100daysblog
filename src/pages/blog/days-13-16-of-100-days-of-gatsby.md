## About Page

I added some much better content to the About page! Now I have a photo of me and a little bio of information about me. I took this opportunity to set up the page as its own CMS item on the NetlifyCMS. This means that all of the page content (title, heading, subheading, bio, bio image, location, etc.) is all pulled from the CMS-populated markdown file. This will be the de facto setup for all pages moving forward.
