## Intro

For this set of days, I put my goals from the previous few days on hold to try and build something a little more ambitious: a boilerplate esports team website. 

# Esports Site

For the Esports site, I wanted to combine a few pieces of functionality that I had experience with and other pieces of functionality that I was unfamiliar with. The site would have:

* Teams pages, displaying info on each team under the organization for each esport. This would leverage MD files and NetlifyCMS.
* Partners pages, which would list the sponsors and partners for the organization. It would use MD / CMS.
* News Blog, using MD / CMS.
* Calendar of events, using MD / CMS.
* Score results, which would be a list of results tied to the calendar leveraging an esports scores API. Updated hourly.
* Merchandise store, all managed in Shopify and using the Gatsby Shopify plugin.
* Social media account numbers, pulling from their APIs.

I'm about halfway done with building this out. I have set up the Blog, Teams, and Store. I'm having a couple integration issues but things are going well overall. I'm hoping to have something basic set up by Day 36.
