bio: >-
  I am a 24 year old dude who loves creating things. As cliche as that is, it is
  what sums up my passions and hobbies. My 9 to 5 hours are spent at HP in
  Houston, Texas working as a UX Designer. My work specifically focuses on our
  design system and a few products. Iâ€™ve been designing all sorts of things for
  10 years now, starting out with logos for a gaming team that my friend and I
  started. Fast forward to now, my focus is on interface design and development
  along with the occasional branding project. My hobbies outside of design
  include more creative pursuits; I have been into photography for a couple of
  years now, and I recently have taken an interest in game development. I am
  still in search of the perfect chocolate shake and I regularly rant about how
  The Lord of the Rings (book and film) series is the greatest creative work of
  all time.
